let's work on nvisy_core

- fix docs in lib.rs by adding in doc links to mentioned structs i.e. [ContentMetadata]: fs::ContentMetadata at the botton of the //! comment, etc
- io,fs,path modules shouldn't make their internal modules public, but they should still reexport all content of their internal modules
- rename DataStructureType into DataStructureKind
- add method to SupportedFormat that returns DataStructureKind
- delete FormatType, replace all of its uses with ContentKind
- ContentKind::from_file_extension should return ContentKind::Unknown if the extension is not recognized
- add default impl for ContentKind (ContentKind::Unknown)
- ContentFile should have its fields private and provide getters for path/source, and add as_file and into_file methods
- rename DataSensitivityLevel into DataSensitivity
- comment types in SupportedFormat
- add mutex around sha256 in ContentData so that we don't need it mutable when getting the hash
- fix all errors in nvisy_core, apply best practices
